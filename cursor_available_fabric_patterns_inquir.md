What patterns do you recommend for reviewing and improving a blog post

**Cursor**

For reviewing and improving a blog post, I recommend these Fabric patterns in a strategic workflow:

## **Analysis & Review Phase**

**`analyze_prose`** - Your primary review tool. Evaluates writing quality, novelty, clarity, and provides specific improvement recommendations.

**`extract_main_idea`** - Identifies if your core message is clear and compelling.

**`rate_content`** - Labels your content with descriptive tags and gives it a quality rating.

**`extract_wisdom`** - Pulls out the most insightful and valuable parts to see if your post delivers real value.

## **Improvement Phase**

**`improve_writing`** - Enhances clarity, coherence, grammar, and style while maintaining your voice.

**`enrich_blog_post`** - Specifically designed for blog content enhancement.

**`humanize`** - Makes your writing sound more natural and conversational if it feels too formal or AI-generated.

## **Structure & Content**

**`create_recursive_outline`** - Helps analyze and improve your post's structure and flow.

**`extract_ideas`** - Lists all key ideas to ensure they're well-organized and complete.

## **Specialized Options**

**`analyze_prose_pinker`** - For more sophisticated prose analysis based on Steven Pinker's writing principles.

**`create_better_frame`** - If your post deals with challenging topics, this finds more positive angles.

## **Recommended Workflow:**
1. Start with `analyze_prose` for comprehensive feedback
2. Use `extract_main_idea` to verify your core message clarity
3. Apply `improve_writing` for enhancement
4. Consider `enrich_blog_post` for blog-specific improvements
5. Use `humanize` if needed for conversational tone
